Reverse video search, in simple words, it takes a video as input to search for similar videos. As we know that video-related tasks are harder to tackle, video models normally do not achieve as high scores as other types of models. However, there are increasing demands in AI applications in video. Reverse video search can effectively discover related videos and improve other applications.
